Upload financial documents, ask about stock prices, or get detailed company analysis - all through a simple chat interface.

## Features

- üìä **Real-time Stock Data** - Get current prices and historical data for any publicly traded company
- üìÑ **Financial Statement Analysis** - Upload files and receive detailed analysis
- üè¢ **Company Insights** - Access income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow data
- üí° **AI-Powered Guidance** - Personalized financial advice powered by Gemini AI

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini API Key
- Telegram Bot created from BotFather
- Telegram Bot Token
- **Public HTTPS URL** (required for webhook functionality)

## Installation & Setup

### Important Note About Local Development

**This application uses webhooks and cannot be run locally without modifications.** Webhooks require a public HTTPS URL that Telegram can reach. 

**Options for development:**

1. **Deploy directly to a cloud service** (Recommended - see Deployment section)
2. **Use ngrok for local development:**
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok and expose your local server
   ngrok http 5000
   # Use the ngrok HTTPS URL for webhook setup
   ```
3. **Modify the code to use polling instead of webhooks** (requires code changes)

### Cloud Deployment Setup

Since this app requires a public HTTPS URL, follow the deployment steps below to get it running.

## Available Commands

- `/start` - Initialize the bot and get welcome message
- Upload financial documents (PDF, CSV, Excel) for AI-powered analysis
- Ask questions about companies, financial metrics, or stock prices

## Overview of Usage

### How It Works

1. **Message Processing**: The bot receives messages through Telegram webhooks
2. **AI Analysis**: User queries are processed by Google Gemini with financial function calling
3. **Data Retrieval**: Latest stock data or financial statements are fetched using yfinance library in function calling
4. **Response Generation**: AI generates human-readable financial insights
5. **Message Delivery**: Responses are sent back through Telegram API

### Getting started

Send the `/start` command to the bot
